            This is a slice operation. 
            row refers to an individual sub-list (i.e., a row of the matrix).
            [:] means you are making a shallow copy of the entire row.
            If you just do row, it would be a reference to the same list, meaning 
            any   modification would reflect in both the original and copied lists. 
            By using [:], you're creating a copy of the row thatâ€™s independent 
            of the original list.
